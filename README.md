Basic car physics engine I wrote in University.

To compile and run it yourself:
From the root directory of the repository:

    javac -d ./ src/cargame/A3.java
    java cargame.A3

### Controls

The control keys for the game are:
Up arrow: causes the car to accelerate
Down arrow: reverse (if currently going forward, it will slow the car down)
Left arrow: turn the car left
Right arrow: turn the car right
Space: apply brakes
